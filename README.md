Grocery Shopping List using Node.js (personal learning project)

v 0.0.1, 2021/02: I'm learning JavaScript and decided to write a WebApp using Node.js and its ecosystem. For DB I'm using PostgreSQL from Heroku's Free Tier. Starting out I'll try to use as few external modules and frameworks as I can, with a main focus on learning modern (ES6+) language features and getting a good grip of CSS on both Desktop and Mobile. THIS IS NOT A REFERENCE PROJECT, AND MOST LIKELY VERY INSECURE TO USE ON PRODUCTION! The database of products will (at least at this stage) be in Portuguese, since it's my main language, but in the future it'll be interesting to add English translations and autodetect user's language.
